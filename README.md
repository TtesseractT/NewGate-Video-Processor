# NewGate-Video-Processor
This Python tool divides video into loud audio segments, applies time-scale modification to audio tracks using the phase vocoder algorithm, and generates new frames at the altered speed to alter playback speed while preserving pitch. Output video has the same pitch, but different speed.
